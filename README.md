# RadioFind

RadioFind is a crowdsourced application that allows a user to search for local radio stations in the area. Features include search by location, search by genre, comment on a radio station, add radio stations, favorite/unfavorite a radio station, and edit a radio station's information. If a user is not registered, he can only search by city. Once a user registers, more features become available.
